## Description

Hello!

This is my pet project for Python Object Oriented Programming and GTK+/Glade practice. 
It is bookkeeping program writen in Python 3.8 and GTK+/Glade libraries and it aimed to keep
records of books which you read. It has remarks functions which allows to make a review for each 
added book. This particular version is writen for linux systems but I'm trying to port it to windows.
This project is not completed yet so it will take some time to make it run smoothly.
